                            Millets for Health is born out of a journey of personal health and transformation and has grown into a social enterprise working on the revival of millets, the ancient Indian Super Foods.

                            The journey of our work is more than a decade long and started in rural Ananthapur, the second most drought prone region in the country. Our partner NGO SHODH works with farmers from the region to support the cause of millet farming. While other crops fail in the agro climatic scenario of this region, Millets survive and thrive, making them the ideal solution. Millets for health was set up in 2016 to market the products of these marginalised and small holder farmers after one of our co-founders transformed her own health by going on a millet based diet.
